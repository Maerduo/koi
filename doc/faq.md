# FAQ

## No user manual ?

It's being rewritten and translated to english.

## Not a web app ?

Yep, no web. Although going full HTML would make our life easier
as far as deployment is concerned, we think that for enterprise
context Qt is the right choice : it is super mature and super
stable. That is, it's predictable and productive.

Now, that was the reasoning when we started Koï. We might reconsider
this if we figure out a good combinations of various HTML UI components.
The biggest dark spot right now is a good and powerful table editor
as Koï ergonomics are quite optimized there.

Moreover, we intend to change the current "direct access to DB"
paradigm to a REST/RPC JSON API. That will make the server installable
on the Cloud.


## No accounting module ?

Yep, that's right. Our customers don't care. They usually use an accountant
who has his own software and process.


## No git history ?

Koï was initially developped as GPL'ed software for a few customers
and it remained in their companies. Now that it's mature enough, we publish
it. However, as time went by, some intellectual property from these
customers was added into our git repository. Since that can't be removed
from the git history, we had to start a new repository, cleaned
from any IP infringement.

## Affero GPL ?

Yep, that's the most aggressive one. We're professionals, we need money.
But we love free software. So, when we wear the free software hat, we make
sure we play with people who wear the same hat (so they won't profit from
us without contributing). When we wear the proprietary hat, well, contact us :-)
Basically, the AGPL will be a trouble for you if you want to build
proprietary code without us. In that case, contact us so we can figure
a business relationship.
