This is Koï
===========

Koï is a production management system. It is aimed at mid-size manufacturing workshops.
It tracks production, quality issues, work done, orders, preorders and a few other things.
It strives to do that in a simple and flexible way, not imposing any specific workflow.
It is therefore aimed at "agile" companies. If you want strict workflow, choose SAP.

It is in production use since a few years (so, yes, it is battle tested).

How to install
==============

On Windows, download the server installer from [here](html/koi_server.exe). Run it as administrator.
Next, download the [client](html/koi_client.exe), run it on the same PC.

For the impatient, you can download a demo [here](html/koi_client_demo.exe)
