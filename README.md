# This is Koï

Koï is a production management system. It is aimed at mid-size manufacturing workshops.
It tracks production, quality issues, work done, orders, preorders and a few other things.
It strives to do that in a simple and flexible way, not imposing any specific workflow.
It is therefore aimed at "agile" companies. If you want strict workflows, choose SAP.

It is in production use since a few years (so, yes, it is battle tested).

# Future

Well, it depends highly on our customers. As you know, many programs like us are
tuned to a specific business. We'll do our best to maintain a common base
and allow for tuning/specialisation. We do mind backward compatibility as we're
oriented towards robustness (we're in the business of supporting companies,
not trying new framework-du-jour :-) ).

Our immediate targets are :
* finding partnerships all over the world
* improve project's documentation and ease of use
